//TO-DO

//Change everything to Static methods referencing the instance \\-||

//Add Instance Null checks to the start of every method --- Somewhat Done (Debating whether or not to have a requirement
//To do most actions to include having a sound. The thought process is if you don't have a sound, you would never have a player to manipulate)

//Move from instantiate every call to a grab from a pool \\-||

//Add every form of action you can take on an AudioPlayer to the AudioPlayer class passing "this" as the AudioPlayer parameter

//Allow binding of multiple string methods to the end of audio player \\-||

// I kinnnnd of want to move to a Scriptable Object approach with the sounds. It means they're easier to change because they're
// not cluttered in an array, and you can potentially even attach them to a GameObject to use that to call a sound from \\-||

//ORGANISE AND COMMENT. USE REGIONS AND SUCH
//ALSO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET RID OF REDUNDENT CODE, AND MAKE THINGS USE 1 BASE FUNCTION ETC (e.g Play(string) and Play(Sound))
